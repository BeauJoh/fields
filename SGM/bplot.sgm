boxplot  
</s-title>
<s-description>
Plots boxplots of several groups of data
and allows for placement at different horizontal or vertical positions. It
is also flexible in the input object accepting either a list or matrix.

<s-usage>
<s-old-style-usage>
bplot(x, style = "tukey", outlier = T, plot = T, ...)
</s-old-style-usage>
</s-usage>
<s-args-required>
<s-arg name="x">
Vector, matrix,  list or data frame. A vector may be divided according
to the by argument. Matrices and data frames are separated by columns and
lists by components.   
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>
<s-args-optional>
<s-arg name="style">
Type of boxplot default is "tukey". The other choice is "quantile" where
the whiskers are drawn to the 5 and 95 percentiles instead being based on
the inner fences. 
 </s-arg>
<s-arg name="outlier">
If true outliers (points beyond outer fences) will be added to the plots. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="plot">
If false just returns a list with the statistics used for plotting the
box plots. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="...">
Other arguments controlling the boxplots ( passed to
bplot.obj) these are
listed below. Other graphical plotting arguments not matched (e.g. yaxt)
are used in the call to plot to set up the intial plot if add=T. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="pos">
The boxplots will be plotted vertically and pos gives the x or y locations
for their centers. If omitted the boxes are equally spaced at integer  
values.  
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="width">
Width of boxplots (in user coordinates) if omitted then the width is a
reasonable fraction of the  
distance between boxes and is set by the space argument. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="labels">
Labels under each boxplot. If missing the columns names or components of  
x are used.  
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="srt">
Rotate the labels (srt=90 makes them vertical). Default is to put them
horizontal. Sometimes long
labels run into each if they are horizontal.   
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="add">
If true, do not create a new plots just add the boxplots to a current
plot. Note  
that the pos argument may be useful in this case and should be in the
user coordinates of the parent plot.  
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="space">
Space between boxplots.  
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="sort.names">
If true plot the boxplot data set names are sorted in alphabetic order by
their labels.  
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="xlab">
Label for the x-axis 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="ylab">
Label for the y-axis 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="ylab">
Label for the y-axis 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="label.cex">
Boxplot label  size where 1.0 is  normal size characters.
If zero labels will not be added.  
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="xaxt">
Plotting parameter for x-axis generation. Default is not to produce
an x-axis. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="outlier">
If true add outliers as plotted points. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="horizontal"> 
If true draw boxplots horizontally the default is false, produce
veritcal box plots. 
</s-arg>

<s-details>
This function was created as a complement to the usual S function for  
boxplots. The current function makes it possible to put the boxplots at  
unequal x or y positions. This is useful for visually grouping a large
set of  
boxplots into several groups. Also placement of the boxplots with  
respect to the axis can add information to the plot.  Another aspect  
is the emphasis on data structures for groups of data. One useful  
feature is the by option to break up the x vector into distinct  groups.   
If 5 or less observations are in a group the points themselves are  
plotted instead of a box.   

The function is broken into two steps: a call to stats.bplot to find the
statistics and a call to bplot.obj to plot the resulting object. 
The user is referred to describe.bplot to modify the statistics used and 
to draw.bplot.obj to modify how the bplot is drawn.

Finally to bin data into groups based on a continuous variable and to make
bplots of each group see bplot.xy.
