<s-title>
Plots a surface and contours 
</s-title>
<s-description>
Creates different plots of the fitted surface of a Krig object. This is a
quick way to look at the fitted function over reasonable default
ranges.  </s-description>
<s-usage>

surface.Krig(obj, grid.list=NA, extrap=F, graphics.reset=T, 
 xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, main = NULL, zlab = NULL, zlim = NULL, 
    levels = NULL, type = "b", ...)

<s-args-required>
<s-arg name="obj">
A Krig object. 
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>
<s-args-optional>
<s-arg name="grid.list">
A list with as many components as variables describing the surface. 
All components should have a single value except the two that give the 
grid points for evaluation. If the matrix or data frame has column names,  
these must appear in the grid list. If grid.list is missing an the
surface has just two dimensions the grid is based on the ranges of the
observed data.
 </s-arg>
<s-arg name="extrap">
Extrapolation beyond the range of the data. If false only the
convex hull of the observations is plotted. Default is false. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="graphics.reset">
Reset to original graphics parameters after function plotting. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="type">
Type of plot as a character. "p" perspective plot (persp). "c" contour
plot (contour). "b" a two panel figure with perspective and contour
plots. "I" image plot with legend strip (image.plot). "C" image plot
with contours overlaid.  Both perspective and contour is the default.
  </s-arg>
<s-arg name="...">
Any other plotting options. 
</s-arg>
</s-args-optional>
<s-details>
This function is essentially a combination of predict.surface and
plot.surface. It may not always give a great rendition but is easy to use
for checking the fitted surface. The default of extrap=F is designed to
discourage looking at the estimated surface outside the range of
the observations.
