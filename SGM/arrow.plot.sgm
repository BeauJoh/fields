Adds arrows to a plot
</s-title>
<s-description>
Adds arrows at specified points where the arrow lengths are scaled to
fit on 
the plot in a reasonable manner. A classic use of this function is to
depict a vector field. At each point (x,y) we have a vector with
components (u,v).  Like the arrows function this adds arrows to an 
existing plot.

<s-usage>
<s-old-style-usage>
arrow.plot(a1, a2, u = NA, v = NA, arrow.ex = 0.05,  
     xpd = T, true.angle = F, ...)
</s-old-style-usage>
</s-usage>
<s-args-required>
<s-arg name="a1">
The x locations of the tails of the arrows or a  2 column matrix giving 
the x and y coordinates of the arrow tails. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="a2">
The y locations of the tails of the arrows or a 2 column matrix giving  
the u and v coordinates of the arrows. 
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>
<s-args-optional>
<s-arg name="u">
The u components of the direction vectors if they are not specified in 
the a2 argument 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="v">
The v  components of the direction vectors if they are not specified in     
the a2 argument 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="arrow.ex">
Controls the length of the arrows. The length is in terms of the fraction 
of the shorter axis in the plot. So with a default of .05 20 arrows  
of maximum length can line up end to end along the shorter axis. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="xpd">
If true does not clip arrows to fit inside the plot region, default is 
not to clip. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="true.angle">
If true preserves the true angle of the (u,v) pair on the plot. E.g. if  
(u,v)=(1,1) then the arrow will be drawn at 45 degrees.  
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="...">
Graphics arguments passed to the arrows function that can can change the 
color or arrow sizes. See help on this for 
details. 
</s-arg>
</s-args-optional>
<s-details>
This function is useful because (u,v) may be in very different scales
from the locations (x,y). So some careful scaling is needed to plot the
arrows. 
The only tricky thing about this function is whether you want the true 
angles on the plot. For overlaying a  vector field on top of contours 
that are the streamlines  true.angle should be false. In this case you 
want u and v to be scaled in the same way as the x and y variables.  
If the scaling is not the same then the arrows will not look like tangent 
vectors to the streamlines.  
An application where the absolute angles are meaningful might be the hands of a 
clock showing different times zones on a world map. Here true.angle=T is
appropriate, the clock hands should preserve the right angles.
