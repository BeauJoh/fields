Response surface experiment ionizing a reagent 
</s-title>
<s-section name="SUMMARY">
The characteristics of an ionizing flame are varied with the intent of 
maximizing the intensity of emitted light for lithuim in 
solution. Areas outside of the measurements are where the mixture may 
explode! Note that the optimum is close to the boundary. Source of data is 
from a master's level lab experiment in 
analytical chemistry from Chuck Boss's course at NCSU. 
<s-section name= "DATA DESCRIPTION">
This is list with the following components

<s-args>
<s-arg name= x >
x is a 2 column matrix with the different Fuel and oxygen flow rates for 
the burner. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name= y >
y is the response. The intensity of light at a particular 
wavelength indicative of Lithium ions.
